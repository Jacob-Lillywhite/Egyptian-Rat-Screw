## Egyptian Slap
Egyptian Slap is a student made game that tries to emulate the card game known as Egyptian Rat Screw. The goal of this project was to create a website, server, and database that handles data asynchronously in order to allow two players to connect with one another and play a simple card game. Made alongside Jason Hawkins and Jordon Stong.
